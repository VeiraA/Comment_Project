	Isaac —  This semester in Ap Statistics, we have had the opportunity to cover topics such as experimental units, t-tests, and p-tests, something we will continue going into the second semester. Over the last couple of months—between nightly homework and assignments—we have had 5 unit tests, a midterm-level final exam, and 1 project, covering the topic of car project.

	 On your unit tests, you have gotten grades of 50, 94, 100, and 100 percent, with an average score of 86.0%. Your lowest score was on our test about experimental units, but that could be because you had to take your brother Max home after school (a very daunting task that takes A TON of time apparently). On the final, you received a grade of 89%, which is an alright score for a midterm exam. You have consistently done the homework over the semester, and have turned in many or all of your assignments as well.  Also, you have missed 3 days of class. You can definetely improve on playing video games during class, not wearing mask in class. 

	That being said, I would like to highlight one of your strengths in my class this year. I have been really impressed by your memorization: a valuable skill which I hope you can continue to use later on in life. Furthermore, I like to applaud how you asked lots of questions. 

	In the end, you are a decent student. I just wish you would play less video games in class. Your overall grade this semester was a C. You have a lot of room for improvement.
