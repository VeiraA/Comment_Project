	Patrick â€” I enjoyed having you in PE Strength and Conditioning, and I am glad you're back for more. This semester in Pe For Life, we have had the opportunity to cover topics such as pillo polo, bench press, and hockey, something we will continue going into the second semester. Over the last couple of months, we have had 4 unit tests, a midterm-level final exam, and 3 projects, including one that is about weightlifting and another covering the extremely fascinating topic of ping-pong.

	It should make you happy to know that your performance in class this year has exceeded our last time together: yet, there's still lots of room for you to improve. On your unit tests, you have gotten grades of 30, 59, and 75 percent, with an average score of 54.67%. Your lowest score was on our test about Hockey, but that could be because you were in quarantine prior to this test and missed half the unit. On the final, you received a grade of 4%, which is quite the bad score for a midterm exam. You have not done much of the homework in my class, and failed to turn in your assignments. You have participated more than others in this class, which is commendable. Also, you have missed 40 days of class. You can definetely improve on showing up on time, grades, and anger. 

	That being said, I would like to highlight one of your strengths in my class this year. I have been really impressed by your collaboration: a valuable skill which I hope you can continue to use later on in life. Furthermore, I like to applaud how you cleaned up after class. 

	In the end, you have struggled quite a bit this year. I hope you can improve going into the second semester. Your overall grade this semester was a D. You need to reconsider your approach to school.
